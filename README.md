# Abra
Abra is a platform where you can order travelers to bring something to you from where they have been, or as a traveler you can bring something from where have you been. Think of an altered version of BlaBlaCar if you may. Instead of taking people from A to B, you bring bags and boxes this time.

## Features
* You can book someone to deliver you whatever you want from and to where, when, what time, how many and for how much in seconds! 😎
* Probably fastest and cheapest way to get goods from all over Turkey. Need a bit more work to make it all over world, and a very big rocket to make it all over the space. But no worries, we will get to that point! 🚀
* Make easy money while helping people by bringing goods from where you have traveled. 💰
* Be a part of thrust worthy community. We will be supplying you rating and commeting. ☺️
